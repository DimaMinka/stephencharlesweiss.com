## What Is This Log?

In 2019, I stopped trying to go to the gym and became someone who goes to the gym as James Clear describes in his book _Atomic Habits_.

As part of that evolution, I kept track of my workouts.

The plan is to keep this list going into 2020 and beyond, though I expect to update it ~semi-annually at most.
